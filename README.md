# Hessen-HeatMap


This script allows for a quick and easy creation of maps and heat maps for the Hessen state of Germany.
This could be useful for reports and visualizations focused on Hessen.
The same code can, of course, be used to create similar maps for any other region in the world.

To create a map, simply open HessenMapCreator.ipynb (not HowToHeatMap.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
The script tells you a few of the parameters you can change to customize your map.
Obviously, there are many other options but I tried to make it as simple and straightforward as possible.

If you have feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out :)
