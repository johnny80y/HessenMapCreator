# Hessen-HeatMap

WARNING: This is an early-stage work in progress!!!

This script allows for a quick and easy creation of maps and heat maps for the Hessen state of Germany.
This could be useful for reports and visualizations focused on Hessen.
The same code can, of course, be used to create similar maps for any other region in the world.

Credit where credit is due: the postal codes for Germany were downloaded here: https://launix.de/launix/launix-gibt-plz-datenbank-frei/
